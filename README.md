# Intelligent Parking Management System (IPMS)

**Our project comprises of a web application that dynamically handles user database, where the user are civilians who can check if they have been allotted any kind of penalty for any offense and also pay the required fine through an online payment gateway. Respected government officials have been allotted unique service through which they can access the ANPR software, which would help them allot fines to violators by simply uploading a number plate image of the vehicle. An ANPR system identifies the characters and numbers present on the license plate and stores them in a string. This allows the authorities to match the string in the pre- existing database and seamlessly, add a fine to the profile of the violator.
The website has a user-friendly user interface, the web application provides user services such as to check existing records, new penalty allocation, payment gateway and can also submit queries through the ‘Contact Us’ page.
The website has a different interface for government officials which allows them to reprimand violators by just uploading the picture of the vehicle’s license plate.
ANPR system is a smart program which can overcome limitations like illumination, speed of car, non-uniform license plate by pre-processing techniques such as adaptive thresholding and Gaussian blur. Further to remove noise such as text which is not the part of the number plate required are being removed via mathematical equations.**
